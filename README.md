## The idea behind the example

Workspaces are a new way to setup your package architecture thatâ€™s available by default starting from Yarn 1.0. It allows you to setup multiple packages in such a way that you only need to run yarn install once to install all of them in a single pass.

In this example we have three workspaces:

- **site1**: A Next.js app
- **site2**: A Next.js app
- **shared**: Shared React components, that gets compiled by Next.js
